    /// a deep pink color which you would specify as #FF1493 in CSS, use
    /// `pins=default|coFF1493||-122 45`
    /// ### Pushpin Labels
    /// To add a label to the pins, put the label in single quotes just before the coordinates. For example, to label

    /// you want to display labels without any pin image. For example,
    /// `pins=none||'A'-122 45|'B'-119.5 43.2`
    /// To change the color of the pushpin labels, use the 'lc' label color style modifier. For example, to use pink
    /// pushpins with black labels, use
    /// `pins=default|coFF1493|lc000000||-122 45`
    /// To change the size of the labels, use the 'ls' label size style modifier. The label size represents the approximate
    /// height of the label text in pixels. For example, to increase the label size to 12, use
    /// `pins=default|ls12||'A'-122 45|'B'-119 43`
    /// The labels are centered at the pushpin 'label anchor.' The anchor location is predefined for built-in pushpins and
    /// is at the top center of custom pushpins (see below). To override the label anchor, using the 'la' style modifier
    /// and provide X and Y pixel coordinates for the anchor. These coordinates are relative to the top left corner of the
    /// pushpin image. Positive X values move the anchor to the right, and positive Y values move the anchor down. For example,
    /// to position the label anchor 10 pixels right and 4 pixels above the top left corner of the pushpin image,
    /// use
    /// `pins=default|la10 -4||'A'-122 45|'B'-119 43`
    /// ### Custom Pushpins
    /// To use a custom pushpin image, use the word 'custom' as the pin style name, and then specify a URL after the
    /// location and label information. Use two pipe characters to indicate that you're done specifying locations and are
    /// starting the URL. For example,
    /// `pins=custom||-122 45||http://contoso.com/pushpins/red.png`
    /// After URL encoding, this would look like
    /// `pins=custom%7C%7C-122+45%7C%7Chttp%3A%2F%2Fcontoso.com%2Fpushpins%2Fred.png`
    /// By default, custom pushpin images are drawn centered at the pin coordinates. This usually isn't ideal as it obscures
    /// the location that you're trying to highlight. To override the anchor location of the pin image, use the 'an'
    /// style modifier. This uses the same format as the 'la' label anchor style modifier. For example, if your custom
    /// pin image has the tip of the pin at the top left corner of the image, you can set the anchor to that spot by
    /// using
    /// `pins=custom|an0 0||-122 45||http://contoso.com/pushpins/red.png`
    /// Note: If you use the 'co' color modifier with a custom pushpin image, the specified color will replace the RGB
    /// channels of the pixels in the image but will leave the alpha (opacity) channel unchanged. This would usually
    /// only be done with a solid-color custom image.
    /// ### Getting Pushpins from Azure Maps Data Storage
    /// For all Azure Maps account SKUs other than S0,
    /// the pushpin location information can be obtained from Azure Maps Data Storage. After uploading a GeoJSON document containing pin locations, the Data Storage service returns a Unique Data ID (UDID) that you can use
    /// to reference the data in the pins parameter.
    /// To use the point geometry from an uploaded GeoJSON document as the pin locations, specify the UDID in the locations
    /// section of the pins parameter. For example,
    /// `pins=default||udid-29dc105a-dee7-409f-a3f9-22b066ae4713`
    /// Note that
    /// only point and multipoint geometry, points and multipoints from geometry collections, and point geometry from features
    /// will be used. Linestring and polygon geometry will be ignored. If the point comes from a feature and the feature
    /// has a string property called "label", the value of that property will be used as the label for the pin.
    /// You can mix pin locations from Data Storage and pin locations specified in the pins parameter. Any of the pipe-delimited
    /// pin locations can be a longitude and latitude or a UDID. For example,
    /// `pins=default||-122 45|udid-29dc105a-dee7-409f-a3f9-22b066ae4713|-119 43`
    /// ### Scale, Rotation, and Opacity
    /// You can make pushpins and their labels larger or smaller by using the 'sc' scale style modifier. This is a
    /// value greater than zero. A value of 1 is the standard scale. Values larger than 1 will make the pins larger, and
    /// values smaller than 1 will make them smaller. For example, to draw the pushpins 50% larger than normal, use
    /// `pins=default|sc1.5||-122 45`
    /// You can rotate pushpins and their labels by using the 'ro' rotation style modifier. This is a number of degrees
    /// of clockwise rotation. Use a negative number to rotate counter-clockwise. For example, to rotate the pushpins
    /// 90 degrees clockwise and double their size, use
    /// `pins=default|ro90|sc2||-122 45`
    /// You can make pushpins and their labels partially transparent by specifying the 'al' alpha style modifier.
    /// This is a number between 0 and 1 indicating the opacity of the pushpins. Zero makes them completely transparent
    /// (and not visible) and 1 makes them completely opaque (which is the default). For example, to make pushpins
    /// and their labels only 67% opaque, use
    /// `pins=default|al.67||-122 45`

    /// and their labels only 67% opaque, use
    /// `pins=default|al.67||-122 45`
    /// ### Style Modifier Summary
    /// Modifier  | Description     | Range
    /// :--------:|-----------------|------------------
    /// al        | Alpha (opacity) | 0 to 1
    /// an        | Pin anchor      | *
    /// co        | Pin color       | 000000 to FFFFFF
    /// la        | Label anchor    | *
    /// lc        | Label color     | 000000 to FFFFFF
    /// ls        | Label size      | Greater than 0
    /// ro        | Rotation        | -360 to 360
    /// sc        | Scale           | Greater than 0
    /// * X and Y coordinates can be anywhere within pin image or a margin around it.
    /// The margin size is the minimum of the pin width and height.
    ///   - path: Path style and locations. Use this parameter to optionally add lines, polygons or circles to the image.
    /// The path style describes the appearance of the line and fill. (Be sure to properly URL-encode values of this
    /// parameter since it will contain reserved characters such as pipes and punctuation.)
    /// Path parameter is supported in Azure Maps account SKU starting with S1. Multiple instances of the path parameter
    /// allow to specify multiple geometries with their styles. Number of parameters per request is limited to 10 and
    /// number of locations is limited to 100 per path.
    /// To render a circle with radius 100 meters and center point at latitude 45°N and longitude 122°W using the default style, add the
    /// querystring parameter
    /// `path=ra100||-122 45`
    /// Note that the longitude comes before the latitude.
    /// After URL encoding this will look like
    /// `path=ra100%7C%7C-122+45`
    /// All of the examples here show the path parameter without URL encoding, for clarity.
    /// To render a line, separate each location with a pipe character. For example, use
    /// `path=||-122 45|-119.5 43.2|-121.67 47.12`
    /// To render a polygon, last location must be equal to the start location. For example, use
    /// `path=||-122 45|-119.5 43.2|-121.67 47.12|-122 45`
    /// Longitude and latitude values for locations of lines and polygons can be in the range from -360 to 360 to allow for rendering of geometries crossing the anti-meridian.
    /// ### Style Modifiers
    /// You can modify the appearance of the path by adding style modifiers. These are added before the locations.
    /// Style modifiers each have a two-letter name. These abbreviated names are used to help reduce the length
    /// of the URL.
    /// To change the color of the outline, use the 'lc' style modifier and specify the color using the HTML/CSS RGB color
    /// format which is a six-digit hexadecimal number (the three-digit form is not supported). For example, to use
    /// a deep pink color which you would specify as #FF1493 in CSS, use
    /// `path=lcFF1493||-122 45|-119.5 43.2`
    /// Multiple style modifiers may be combined together to create a more complex visual style.
    /// `lc0000FF|lw3|la0.60|fa0.50||-122.2 47.6|-122.2 47.7|-122.3 47.7|-122.3 47.6|-122.2 47.6`
    /// ### Getting Path locations from Azure Maps Data Storage
    /// For all Azure Maps account SKUs other than S0, the path location information can be obtained from Azure Maps Data Storage.
    /// After uploading a GeoJSON document containing path locations, the Data Storage service returns a Unique Data ID (UDID) that you can use
    /// to reference the data in the path parameter.
    /// To use the point geometry from an uploaded GeoJSON document as the path locations, specify the UDID in the locations
    /// section of the path parameter. For example,
    /// `path=||udid-29dc105a-dee7-409f-a3f9-22b066ae4713`
    /// Note the it is not allowed to mix path locations from Data Storage with locations specified in the path parameter.

    ///   - clientRequestId: A client-generated, opaque value with 1KB character limit that is recorded in analytics logs.
    ///   - cancellationToken: A token used to make a best-effort attempt at canceling a request.
    ///   - dispatchQueue: A dispatch queue on which to call the completion handler. Defaults to `DispatchQueue.main`.
    ///   - context: A `PipelineContext` object to associate with the request.

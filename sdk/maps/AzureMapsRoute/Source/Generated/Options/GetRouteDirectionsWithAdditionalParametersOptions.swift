    ///   - constantSpeedConsumptionInKwHPerHundredKm: Specifies the speed-dependent component of consumption.
    /// Provided as an unordered list of speed/consumption-rate pairs. The list defines points on a consumption curve. Consumption rates for speeds not in the list are found as follows:
    /// * by linear interpolation, if the given speed lies in between two speeds in the list
    /// * by linear extrapolation otherwise, assuming a constant (ΔConsumption/ΔSpeed) determined by the nearest two points in the list
    /// The list must contain between 1 and 25 points (inclusive), and may not contain duplicate points for the same speed. If it only contains a single point, then the consumption rate of that point is used without further processing.
    /// Consumption specified for the largest speed must be greater than or equal to that of the penultimate largest speed. This ensures that extrapolation does not lead to negative consumption rates.
    /// Similarly, consumption values specified for the two smallest speeds in the list cannot lead to a negative consumption rate for any smaller  speed.
    /// The valid range for the consumption values(expressed in kWh/100km) is between 0.01 and 100000.0.
    /// Sensible Values : 50,8.2:130,21.3
    /// This parameter is required for **Electric consumption model**.
    ///   - currentChargeInKwH: Specifies the current electric energy supply in kilowatt hours (kWh).
    /// This parameter co-exists with **maxChargeInkWh** parameter.
    /// The range of values allowed are 0.0 to **maxChargeInkWh**.
    /// Sensible Values : 43
    ///   - maxChargeInKwH: Specifies the maximum electric energy supply in kilowatt hours (kWh) that may be stored in the vehicle's battery.
    /// This parameter co-exists with **currentChargeInkWh** parameter.
    /// Minimum value has to be greater than or equal to **currentChargeInkWh**.
    /// Sensible Values : 85
    ///   - auxiliaryPowerInKw: Specifies the amount of power consumed for sustaining auxiliary systems, in kilowatts (kW).
    /// It can be used to specify consumption due to devices and systems such as AC systems, radio, heating, etc.
    /// Sensible Values : 1.7
    ///   - clientRequestId: A client-generated, opaque value with 1KB character limit that is recorded in analytics logs.
    ///   - cancellationToken: A token used to make a best-effort attempt at canceling a request.
    ///   - dispatchQueue: A dispatch queue on which to call the completion handler. Defaults to `DispatchQueue.main`.
    ///   - context: A `PipelineContext` object to associate with the request.
